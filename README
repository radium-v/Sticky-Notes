Sticky Notes - an HTML5 experiment.
** Targeted for Chrome and Safari **
I don't even know what would happen if you tried this in Internet Explorer. I don't recommend trying.

This is a project I made to help me learn JavaScript. I wrote as many functions as I thought were reasonable to avoid using heavy JQuery.

Future stuff:
    Integration with Google Tasks API
    Star/favorite notes
    Sort between lists
    Due Notifications
    Note style customizations (resize, color, fonts, etc.)
    Better delete handling (drag to trash icon?)

Note: the file "htaccess" should be named ".htaccess" if deploying.
